# Efficient-Cooling-of-Data-Centers
As part of a Course Project under Prof. P. Sunthar and Prof. Ojus Mohan at the Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, I conducted an in-depth analysis of waste heat recovery strategies for low-temperature, high-volume waste heat generation in industrial processes. The study aimed to optimize waste heat utilization to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs. By evaluating temperature differences between inlet and outlet streams, I identified opportunities for maximizing heat recovery. Additionally, I applied Internal Flow concepts to develop a computational model, generating temperature profiles that provided deeper insights into system efficiency and enhanced my understanding of heat recovery mechanisms.
